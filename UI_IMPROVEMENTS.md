# UI Improvements & Future Features

Here are some suggestions to take this portfolio to the next level:

## Visual Enhancements
- **Custom Cursor**: Add a custom cursor that reacts to hover states (e.g., expands over links).
- **Page Transitions**: Use Barba.js or similar to add smooth transitions between pages if you expand to a multi-page site.
- **Parallax Effects**: Add parallax scrolling to background elements or images.
- **3D Elements**: Integrate Three.js for a 3D hero object or interactive background.

## Functional Additions
- **Blog Section**: Add a blog to share technical articles and insights.
- **Backend Integration**: Connect the contact form to a real backend service like Formspree or EmailJS.
- **CMS Integration**: Use a headless CMS (Contentful, Sanity) to manage projects and content dynamically.
- **PWA Support**: Make the site installable as a Progressive Web App.

## Performance
- **Image Optimization**: Convert images to WebP format for faster loading.
- **Lazy Loading**: Ensure all below-the-fold images use `loading="lazy"`.
- **Minification**: If moving to a build process, minify HTML, CSS, and JS files.
